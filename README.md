# CommNetManager
An implementation of KSP's CommNet that allows multiple CommNet mods to function alongside each other.
More to come...

NOTE: CommNetManager may be freely distributed alongside the GameData folder for any mods that make use of it. Please ensure that its directory is /GameData/CommNetManager to ensure that only one copy is installed by the user. You will also have to have a copy of the API .dll in the folder with your plugin.
